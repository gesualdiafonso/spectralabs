Welcome to Spectra Labs, a visionary front-end project that brings immersive technology to life. This web application is a futuristic e-commerce prototype focused on the sale of realistic eyewear for Augmented Reality (AR), Mixed Reality (MR), and Virtual Reality (VR).

Developed as part of a university assignment for the Web Development and Design course, the objective was to design and implement a complete and dynamic digital storefront‚Äîcombining modern web technologies with a bold, sci-fi-inspired visual identity.

# üöÄ Project Overview
Spectra Labs was built using the following technologies:

-- **HTML5** ‚Äì Semantic, accessible markup.
-- **CSS3** ‚Äì Custom styling with responsive design.
-- **Bootstrap** ‚Äì Fast and consistent UI components.
-- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** ‚Äì Core logic and interactivity.
